# Styling

We want to decouple the definition of objects and relations (the
*facts*, aka the way things *are*) from their presentation (the
*styling*, or how things are *displayed*).

To that end, we put facts in one file and styles in another. We can
hope to have a common style file that will be reused with many models.

The style file will use the same fact syntax.
